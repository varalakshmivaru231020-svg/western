They look, feel, and function like natural teeth, providing improved comfort, better eating ability, and enhanced confidence in your smile.\n\nDental implants replace missing teeth with a titanium post that functions like an artificial root. Once the implant integrates with the jawbone, it can support a crown, bridge, or denture with excellent stability and a very natural appearance.\n\nOne major benefit of implants is bone preservation. When a tooth is missing for a long time, the jawbone in that area can gradually shrink. Implants help stimulate the bone and reduce that loss, which supports long-term facial structure and oral function.\n\nImplants are more durable than other replacement options and can last 25+ years with proper care.

Manual brushes can be just as effective, but they require a more meticulous technique.\n\nDon't forget to replace your brush (or brush head) every three to four months, or sooner if the bristles become frayed.
